Gun policy is a small D3.js project that I made for a [Rutgers Ethitech](https://www.instagram.com/rutgersethitech/?hl=en) meeting to demonstrate the outstanding impacts of corporate lobbying in gun policy. I sourced my data from [Open Secrets](https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/lobbying.php?ind=Q13) and manually cleaned it with Google Sheets.
