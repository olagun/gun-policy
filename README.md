Gun policy is a small D3.js project that I made to demonstrate the outstanding impacts of corporate lobbying in gun policy. I sourced my data from [Open Secrets](https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/lobbying.php?ind=Q13) and manually cleaned it with Google Sheets. 

P.S. I created this demo for [Rutgers Ethitech](https://www.instagram.com/rutgersethitech/?hl=en) a club for social good in tech @ Rutgers. They're doing great work, give them a follow!
